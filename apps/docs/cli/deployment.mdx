<Steps>
  <Step title="Add 'build' script to ./package.json">
    ```diff
     {
       "scripts": {
         ...
    +    "build": "email build",
         ...
       }
     }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change 'Framework Preset' on Vercel's project settings to Next.js">
    You also need to add "next" at least a devDependency so that it works properly:

    ```diff
     {
       "devDependencies": {
         ...
    +    "next": "*",
         ...
       }
     }
    ```

    This is a limitation on Vercel's Next Framework Preset.

  <Step title="Change 'Output Directory' to .react-email/.next"></Step>
</Steps>

In the end, your settings should look like this:
